		<h2>First Weekly Assignment</h2>
		<p>For the first weekly technical assignment, I've created a simple landing page. This landing page will be used to link other weekly assignments, as well as acting as the completed first weekly assignment.</p>
		<p>This page also demonstrates methods to resize elements depending on different display sizes and aspect ratios.</p>
		<p>The majority of my web development was self-taught, prier to taking any web development courses, recently however, I did run through a couple of course provided by Codecademy.</p>
		<p>I will be constantly upadating this page as the course continues, making sure it's up to date with all of the weekly assignments.</p>
